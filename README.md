## Description
Buen Provecho is a recipe search tool, that allows you to search over a million recipes, save them and refer back to them later. Buen Provecho also allows for you to hire
chefs on demand to come and cook at your home.

## Installation

The best way to get started developing on Buen Provecho is to clone a copy of our repo and from the root of the directory run:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the code locally you need to run Mongod:
 ```sh
mongod
```

You will also need a localserver on port 3090. You can launch the local server with:

```sh
node server/server.js
```

#### Prerequisites

You will need to have API keys from [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com/).

Yummly powers the recipe search integration.
